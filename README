To run FaulLoc. 

1) In the directory where all .ml files (modify, coverage, diff,.. ), I created faultLoc.ml . 
to compile faultLoc.ml:

ocamlc str.cma -o faultLoc faultLoc.ml

2) to create fault faultLoc.txt in the format to be used by MUT-APR-FL do teh following steps: 
		
			a - go in the directory where you have the faulty code and all fiels needed by MUT-APR to repair the faults. This folder should be inside the folder which contains 
			  all .ml files
			b - run ./prog-coverage on each test input to create path file
			c - rename path fiels as they are generated ( e.g., (1) run./prog-coverage passingTestinput which will generate prog.c.path, (2) rename 
			 the generated file to Gpath1). When you run prog-coverage on passing test, rename generated file as Gpath# (#: anything you want). And when you 
			 run prog-coverage on failing test, rename generated file as Npath# (#: anything you want).  
			d - concatenat all Gpath and Npath files to generate one file and name it fullpath. To do so, write the following command:
				cat Gpath1 Gpath2 Npath1 Npath2 > fullpath
			e - Then run:
					../faultLoc --pass NUMPASSTTESTS --fail NUMFAILTESTS GpathNUM GpathNUM NpathNUM NpathNUM fullpath
					e.g., ../faultLoc --pass 2 --fail 2 Gpath1 Gpath1 Npath1 Npath2 fullpath
